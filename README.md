# BMI Calculator using Python

This project is developed as part of my Python internship program.  
It is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that takes user input and
classifies the BMI into health categories.

## Objective
To calculate BMI using weight and height and display the health category
such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI version, if used)
- Visual Studio Code

## How It Works
1. User enters weight in kilograms.
2. User enters height in meters.
3. Program calculates BMI using formula:
   BMI = weight / (height * height)
4. BMI value and category are displayed to the user.

## Features
- User input validation
- Accurate BMI calculation
- Health category classification
- Simple and user-friendly interface (GUI version)
